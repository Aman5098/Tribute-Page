						doctors placed the time of death at 10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June at
						11:30 p.m.—meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time). No foul play

						August 2020, the Supreme Court of India allowed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the
						Indian national government's top investigating agency, to take control of the investigation
						and ordered the CBI to look into any future cases registered in relation to Rajput's death.
						Later, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) also filed a case to investigate drug peddling, based
						on phone chats forwarded to it by ED during its investigation.</p>
